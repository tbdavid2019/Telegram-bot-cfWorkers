# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **A2A LLM Context Injection**: Fixed `No LLM provider enabled for A2A` error by providing the complete `ENV.USER_CONFIG` context to the receiving peer's LLM initiator. 
- **Cloudflare Error 1042 Bypass**: Bypassed same-zone worker fetch limits by utilizing Cloudflare Service Bindings (`WORKER_ENV[peer.binding]`) for internal A2A communication.
- **A2A Delegate Parameter Parsing**: Improved parsing of `[CALL:/delegate]` parameters to strip surrounding quotes and trailing whitespaces, preventing `peer not found` errors.
- **LLM Peer Discovery**: Registered `/delegate` into global command handlers and exposed `A2A_PEERS` via the dynamic system prompt so the LLM is correctly informed of peer aliases.
